Huffman encoding is an algorithm which outputs compressed data from input file(usually ascii format). By using greedy approach, it encodes most ouccuring character as shortest one in binary format. This technique is based on binary tree, priority queue.

Back then, I had removed Line feed character for mistake because it wasn't show up when I print it(yeah, I was foolish). I thought it was buggy. Now I understand why it was not. Just looking into the ascii table is enough.
